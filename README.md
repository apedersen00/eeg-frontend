## Overview

The project explores the challenges and techniques of analog design in submicron technologies, focusing on designing an analog front-end capable of EEG signal acquisition. The front-end includes:

- **Neural Amplifier (NA)**: A low-noise amplifier for weak signals.

- **Programmable Gain Low-Pass Filter (LPF)**: Filters high-frequency noise while providing additional gain.

- **Sample-and-Hold (S/H) Circuit**: Captures signal values for ADC conversion.

- **Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC**: Designed by Phillip Ferreira Baade-Pedersen.
